Project C was pretty challenging for me. I managed to get the raw code done but some things are not working how they are supposed to be. When I ran the program, I wasn't able to get message.txt to print out. I managed to create shell identically how kernal was created and did my best with type and execute. Again however, it is not printing what I want it too when ran unless I am doing it wrong. I have everything new added to compileOS.sh as well.  Compiling and running is the same as instructed in the project. The lines needed for specific parts are commented out in main.
